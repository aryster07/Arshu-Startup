## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Browser History API
Every navigation now creates a history entry:
```typescript
window.history.pushState(
  { view: 'dashboard', dashboardView: 'consultant' },
  '',
  window.location.href
);
```

### Back Button Listener
Listens for back button/gestures:
```typescript
window.addEventListener('popstate', handlePopState);
```

### Modal History Management
Opening a modal adds to history:
```typescript
// Open profile
window.history.pushState({ modal: 'lawyer-profile', lawyerId: 1 }, '', '');

// Press back → Modal closes automatically
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

### URL-Based Routing (Future Enhancement)
You could add actual URL changes:
```
/dashboard/consultant
/dashboard/cases
/lawyer/123
```
This would enable:
- Shareable links
- Bookmarkable pages
- SEO benefits

### Deep Linking (Future Enhancement)
Share specific pages:
```
https://lawbandhu.com/lawyer/priya-sharma
→ Opens directly to that lawyer's profile
```
